  # these external DNS resolvers will be used. Blocky picks 2 random resolvers from the list for each query
  # format for resolver: [net:]host:[port][/path]. net could be empty (default, shortcut for tcp+udp), tcp+udp, tcp, udp, tcp-tls or https (DoH). If port is empty, default port will be used (53 for udp and tcp, 853 for tcp-tls, 443 for https (Doh))
  # this configuration is mandatory, please define at least one external DNS resolver
  default:
    # example for tcp+udp IPv4 server (https://digitalcourage.de/)
    - 5.9.164.112
    # Cloudflare
    - 1.1.1.1
    # example for DNS-over-TLS server (DoT)

# optional: definition, which DNS resolver(s) should be used for queries to the domain (with all sub-domains). Multiple resolvers must be separated by a comma

conditional:
  # optional: replace domain in the query with other domain before resolver lookup in the mapping
  rewrite:
